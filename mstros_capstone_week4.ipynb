    "European culture is largely rooted in what is often referred to as its \"common cultural heritage\". Because of the great number of perspectives which can be taken on the subject, it is impossible to form a single, all-embracing conception of European culture. Nonetheless, there are core elements which are generally agreed upon as forming the cultural foundation of modern Europe. "

    "Using Machine Learning clustering techniques, I will group the cities in clusters to determine:\n",

    "* Classification of capitals into clusters and their visualization\n",
    "\n",
    "Even though cuisine is usually a significant contributor to a nation's culture, I will leave out restaurants from the comparison. The idea is that while in Italy you will probably want to eat italian food and while in Berlin you will want to eat german food, even though there are hundreds of italian restaurants. Thus it does not make much sense in this scenario to cluster cities by the presence of restaurants. However, it might be a iteresting topic to explore in a separate project. \n",
